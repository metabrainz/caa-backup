# caa-backup

Script to create a copy of the CAA.

This repo is private as to not advertise that we are making a copy of it.

## How to run

First create virtual env from requirements.txt. Then make a backup directory no where to store
the images. Then run:

   ./caa-backup.py <backup dir>

And wait. and wait some more. and more. Maybe 20 days?
